# Installation

To install Laravel, you can use Composer and the create-project command. Ensure you specify the version for consistency.

```
composer create-project laravel/laravel=10 MonApp
```

This command constructs the Laravel application structure and installs necessary dependencies automatically.

# Project Structure Overview

After installing Laravel, your project directory will be organized as follows:

- **app:** Main folder for your application's code. It acts as the root namespace (\App) and where most coding takes place.

- **bootstrap:** Contains code necessary to start your Laravel application.

- **config:** Holds configuration files (mail.php, cache.php, etc.) formatted as associative arrays.

- **database:** Contains elements related to the database, including sub-folders discussed later.

- **public:** The public-facing root of your application. The index.php file here is Laravel's entry point.

- **resources:** Contains front-end assets like CSS and JavaScript. Also includes a views folder specifying files to generate HTML pages.

- **routes:** Defines application paths for web, API, console, and websockets. It directs actions when certain URLs are accessed.

- **storage:** Contains files generated by your application, such as user uploads and hidden files.

- **.env:** Configuration file for environment variables. Important: Never version this file; it's already set in .gitignore.


# Artisan Commands

Laravel includes artisan, a command-line tool for various operations. For example, to start the development server:

```
php artisan serve
```
This command launches a web server on port 8000, making your application accessible at localhost:8000 during development.

## Additional Info about Bootstrap folder 

Certainly! The bootstrap folder in a Laravel project plays a crucial role in the application's initialization process. It contains essential files and settings that are executed when your Laravel application starts. Let's explore the contents of the bootstrap folder in more detail:

## bootstrap/app.php
The app.php file is the starting point of your Laravel application. It bootstraps the Laravel framework and sets up various services and configurations. It includes settings for error handling, service providers, and application configuration.

## bootstrap/autoload.php
The autoload.php file loads the Composer autoloader, enabling the automatic loading of classes and files within your project. Composer manages your project's dependencies, and this file ensures that all the required classes and files are loaded when needed.

## bootstrap/cache
This folder contains cached files generated by Laravel to optimize the performance of your application. Caching frequently accessed data, such as configuration files and routes, can significantly speed up your application's response time. However, you generally don't need to interact with the files in this folder directly, as Laravel manages caching automatically.

## bootstrap/config.php
The config.php file is responsible for loading the application configuration. It sets up environment-specific settings and loads configuration files based on the environment (development, production, etc.). Laravel uses the values in this file to configure various aspects of the application.

## bootstrap/environment.php
This file determines the current environment of your application, such as local, production, or testing. The environment affects the behavior of your application, allowing you to have different configurations and settings based on the deployment environment.

## bootstrap/helpers.php
The helpers.php file contains various helper functions that can be used throughout your Laravel application. These functions provide convenient shortcuts for common tasks, making it easier and more efficient to write code.

## bootstrap/services.php
The services.php file configures the service providers for your application. Service providers are an essential part of Laravel's service container, providing various services and features to your application. This file specifies which service providers should be registered and used by your application.

In summary, the bootstrap folder in Laravel contains critical files and configurations necessary for the proper initialization of your application. It handles tasks such as autoloading classes, setting up the application environment, caching, loading configuration files, and managing service providers. Understanding the contents of this folder is essential for developers working with Laravel, as it provides insight into the application's core initialization process.
